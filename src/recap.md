  2021 has been a trying year for all of us and through it all, I think it would be fair to say, that we've all come to appreciate our communitites much more. It is the people around us, physically and also virtually, and these connections that should be celebrated more often and with more vigour.
  For the Creative Coding India community, this celebration is a monthly event, at the CCSante meetup, organised by [Mathura](https://www.instagram.com/mathuramg/) and [Karthik](https://www.instagram.com/karthik.dondeti/). Usually on the second Saturday of every month, we all gather, there is a show and tell, followed by discussions and sometimes, what we like to call, mass programming, where everyone gets on a shared P5Live sketch to try and work on a simple prompt.

  And so for the Processing Community Day this year, we thought of doing something similar, with essentially the same format but slightly more organised. A Call for Proposals was sent out, followed by making a poster and this website.
  
  On Saturday 21st August, we all gathered in the evening, from our own rooms and corners to celebrate üéâ
  We started with Mrityunjay and Vinay from [Ayahi](https://www.instagram.com/ayahi_create/?hl=en) taking us into a deep dive of one of their projects called [Somni](https://ayahi.in/somni/), an immersive audiovisual installation. They first brought it to Pondicherry, while fully self funding the entire project, and later took it to Auroville. Mrityunjay describes himself as a music composer while Vinay is the technical brain behind the installation, and so one of them would come up with slightly(or not) fantastical ideas while the other would think of how to practically get them up and running. They are both very fascinated with the idea of using technology as a means of creative expression and they started Ayahi with a broad and wide interpretation of creative coding as encompassing fields of hardware, software, and everything in between. They wanted to see how people, who had not had much experience of audio visual installations before, would react to something like Somni, and how far they could push their own boundaries in bringing this experience to life. A fascinating constraint that they had to work with was covid regulations, where people would have to maintain social distancing and all the interactions were made touch-free. Since they are fully self funded, hardware and materials were used as modules, free to be taken apart and built into something else. The installation had clouds made out of loofahs, columns of light controlled by music generation, hanging bulbs that responded to heartrate(for example if you ran üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and spatial flow fields just waiting for someone to dance.

  Next came [Archita](https://www.instagram.com/the_crude_artist) to take us through her project that combines DNA sequencing with art. Having a background of Biotechnology, when she started her Masters in Design, she came naturally upon this idea of what if we could make fantastical creatures with a given set of characteristics and then visualise them. While being not very happy with her initial results, she methodically made a list of pros and cons, and realised that possibly it would be better to focus on DNA first and move forward from it into further territories. She explored the COVID-19 variant and it's DNA, mapping the genome into colors, and then stumbled upon the idea of using very particular genes(i.e. much smaller sequences of DNA), like the gene responsible for a rose's smell. Mapping DNA components to numbers, allowed her to look at her artwork and intuitively know which base pair is dominant in the picture! üòÆ

  From DNA, we moved onto sewing. [Chandra](http://chandra.fun/) talked us through the intricacies of sewing machines and their interfaces, and how his project looked at simplifying this process, enabling hobbyists an easy access to this fun and creative physical activity. During the researcch and interviewing process, they realised that sewing machines can seem intimidating and complex to even their daily users, and so wondered how the design of the interface and its visual languages could be simplified to make it more accessible to everyone. While working on prototyping, they realised that p5js proved to be very flexible and helpful in working through the iterations and interactions. A key understanding for them was in realising that creative coding frameworks like processing could be used in prototyping interactions and interfaces and are not just limited to expressions of visual art.

  Next up, [Pixelkar](https://www.instagram.com/pixelkar/) introduced us to the world of NFTs and blockchains, and how computational artists could earn a living by selling their artwork through these new and evolving channels. While going over the technicalities of blockchains and decentralised systems, he explained how artists stand to earn royalties from every secondary sale of their artwork on NFT platforms, thus enabling them to continuing to have a flow of finance in some form. While in such a transaction, the owner of the artwork would be the buyer the artist would own reproduction rights. And since this is a hotly debated topic among artists and technologists both, there were quite a few questions that came up during the ensuing short discussion.
  
  TODO :: insert pictures, talk about marketplaces mentioned
  
  We finished the talks with a presentation by [Allwin](https://allwinwilliams.com/) who spoke about the [realtime emoji tracker](https://allwinwilliams.com/emoji-sentiments-twitter/) that he built using Twitter. With the question of what does our emoji usage collectively say about us, he found an emoji live tracking data service. In order to understand this enormous data more effectively, he decided to build an emoji meter, which then further led to him thinking about how best to tell a story. Deciding to give labels to these emojis to categorise them, it came about that, while some labels were implicit, others like sentiment, had to be given explicitly. He experimented with different ways of visualising the same data but now with these labels, and found some to be more effective than others at being able to tell a story. He also extended this idea into their personal life by exporting chats of Whatsapp groups that they were in, and conducting this analysis on the emojis present in those conversations. Since this is live, it is also possible to take a peek at it during eventful days, like for example when India wins or loses a cricket match, and see for yourself how collectively we seem to be responding through emojis.

  On wrapping up the talks, we decided to move into breakout rooms, one of which was for beginners to showcase their recent explorations and sketches and generally interact with each other, while the second one was for more serious conversations ranging from the intricacies of having a new media studio and financing your own projects to building maker spaces that enable collaboration and contextualising computational art in our non-western histories.
  
  We ended the evening with a pair programming session involving about 20 people (hence the term mass programming above üòÇ) and decided to make a cake! üç∞ While a few of the attendees had real cake during the session, the rest of us had to do with this virtual one.

  And although we didn't get the time to talk about this during the session, [Dharma](https://www.instagram.com/dhrmatj/) brought this year's poster to life by laser cutting and plotting it! üéâ

    - Q: Do you think the experience would be better or worse if the covid regulations were not in place?
      - The limitations ended up delimiting the scope of the project, which helped us make an effective and powerful  experience. Without them, we probably wouldn‚Äôt have been able to execute what we did in the time frame that we   had; our heads as artists would have been more up in the clouds, probably..
    - Q: Most memorable hurdles/ hacks/ learnings for others?
      - Completely forgot to mention this : 
        Outdoor installations have a huge disadvantage - you're dependent on the weather. Make sure you read the forecast and have contingency plans!! While we knew rains were around and designed our electronics to be waterproof, nothing can prepare you for when it actually starts pouring. On our opening day in Auroville, the entire exhibition was completely washed off by sudden and heavy rains. We were running around like ants putting covers over electronics, bringing whatever we could indoors. We spent the entire next day blow drying all our electronics and brushing off the soil. We had to postpone it until a few weeks later. Tips: Good quality trash can bags are great for water protection as they are big. Enclose electronics in plastic containers, preferably sealed with hot glue (and even then water might get in). Emergency drill exercises can be helpful.
    - Q: How did you manage working with multiple sensors?
      - Each experience was standalone in the sense that it had a separate computer that connected to the devices. The kinect and leap motion were connected individually. The PIR motion sensors on the other hand were all connected to a NodeMCU and that relayed the data to the system. We would be happy to dive deeper into the tech part if you wish.
    - Q: How much of what you envisioned were you able to execute uncompromised? And how much of it manifested along the way?
      - 75% percent was manifested on the way. Most design choices were made through experimentation. We had a basic direction but as to the final look and feel, it boiled down to what was being able to manifest. We also had time and resources working against us, so we needed to take things as they came.
    - Q: Do you guys keep all the tech tied up to the project or would you source things available in the different venues?
      - Well given that we also were looking at an experience package model for SOMNI we built with the mindset of keeping it modular and adaptable to any venue. Most of the bigger tech like speakers, projectors, computers, iPads were either borrowed or personal. Between the first and second iteration the speakers and projectors were different since they were provided by the venue itself. Anything that was customised for the experience (Light columns or boxes) is built such that it can be dis/assembled and reconfigured.
    - Q: Who was your audience? Did prior knowledge of that (if so) affect your creative choices? 
      - We expected only friends and family and probably some others.  But when word began to spread and since our installation was over the weekend (Pondy attracts thousands of tourists from all over) we had a huge inrush of people we didn‚Äôt expect. 
      Still, we actually made the decision to keep the entrance completely free and make the thing donation based, if they enjoyed the experience. Our aim was to get as many people as possible, from as diverse a demographic as possible- which is what we finally got. From the artistic point of view, we knew that Pondy/Auroville has a very open culture for new ideas, so we did have that luxury to be more abstract with our creative choices, than say a commercial setting in some other urban town. But other than that, we were only guided by our own vision of what we wanted to do, and hoped it would gel with the audience.

    - Q: What is a codon
      - It is a combination of 3 consecutive nucleotides of DNA strand. Which binds with t- RNA to make protein.

    - Q: does the sewing machine run chrome? 
      - for your question on OS, the sewing machine concept was intended to run on something simple I guess, like a raspberry PI. Given we were in a student project on a time limit, we never got around to thinking about that
    - Q: Apart from using processing in the process how feasible you think it would have been to use processing in the final product??
      - Processing in final product - Maybe very viable. We were already using p5 library to render the various shapes. That may continue.

    - Q: Is it location specific, does it take tweets from all over the world?
      - It‚Äôs all over the world. A different narrative can be built if it‚Äôs location specific. Would be an interesting concept to explore though.
